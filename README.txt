/**
 * Cumulus for Drupal
 * README.txt
 */

Cumulus is a module that provides a beautiful, Flash-based 3D tag cloud
implementation as a view style.
It is based on Roy Tanck's WordPress module called WP-Cumulus.
See:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cumulus/

/**
 * Installing
 */

After you put Cumulus in your sites/all/modules or sites/default/modules (or
where ever you put them :-) ) please enable or create a view with cumulus
selected as its output style.

/**
 * Usage
 */
The main idea of cumulus was to display a cloud of taxonomy terms weightend by
their usage count. Views can easily do that but so much more. Maybe you use the
userpoints module and want to provide a view of users with the most points as a
rotaing flash cloud. Or maybe a list uf latest or most accessed nodes. The only
limit is that you can only display plain ASCII textual links.
